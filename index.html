                <h2>A little about me</h2>
                <p>I've made my home base in Providence, Rhode Island with my small growing family. My journey into tech started with a degree in journalism.As I started sharing my writing online, I was fascinated with how easily I could get my voice out there. I was hooked and wanted to learn how to build my own site to fit my own specific needs.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="half-width">
                <p>That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut. When I learned how to build my first website, I realized I found something that gave me the freedom & versatility I was looking for in my work. Now I've made a full switch to front-end developement, where I can use my organization work and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code.
